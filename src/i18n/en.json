An <strong>Olympus</strong> compact, which <strong>I still keep</strong> and cherish, even though it no longer works.",

But they still enjoy it. <strong>They are memories, and they are quality memories.</strong> However, I remember perfectly <strong>the day when my brain went BING!</strong> and I knew that <strong>the camera and photography were going to be my allies for the rest of my life.</strong>",
    "img1-p4": "One day with my friends at <strong>the Warner Park in Madrid</strong>, with those sets simulating a dark street in the <strong>Spiderman's New York</strong>, I set the timer, and <strong>we all posed as if we were a music band</strong>. I was amazed at how they turned out, and then at home, I <strong>edited them with PhotoScape</strong> and WOW. So many cool stuff you can do!!",
